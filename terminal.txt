Advanced software development with Python involves using advanced features of the language, libraries, and frameworks to create more efficient, high-quality code that is optimized for speed and scalability. In addition, it also involves best practices for structuring code, organizing data, and debugging problems in a well-managed manner.

One of the key benefits of Python is its extensive ecosystem of libraries and frameworks. These include Django, Flask, NumPy, SciPy, TensorFlow, and PyTorch among others, all of which are designed to work together to build complex applications with minimal effort.

Another important aspect of software development in Python is the usage of decorators. Decorators are functions that modify the behavior of other functions without changing their code. This allows developers to reuse common logic across multiple methods or classes and can help reduce boilerplate code by automating repetitive tasks.

Advanced syntax in Python includes features such as context managers, f-strings, keyword-only arguments, and type hinting. Context managers provide a way to allocate and release resources that are used during a certain period of time automatically, while f-strings allow developers to use string formatting without breaking up the code into multiple lines or requiring unnecessary imports. Keyword-only arguments ensure that the function is called with only named parameters that are specified in advance. Type hinting provides a way for other developers to understand what type of input and output a function expects, making it easier to maintain and integrate different components together.

Overall, advanced software development with Python requires a combination of knowledge of programming concepts and use of established practices and libraries, as well as an understanding of the language's capabilities for building scalable applications.
