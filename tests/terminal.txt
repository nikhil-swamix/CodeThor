Here are some advanced software development concepts and syntax examples in Python:

**1. Decorators**

Decorators are a powerful feature in Python that allow you to modify or extend the behavior of a function or class without changing its source code.

Example:
```
def my_decorator(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Something is happening before the function is called.")
        func()
        print("Something is happening after the function is called.")
    return wrapper

@my_decorator
def say_hello():
    print("Hello!")

say_hello()
```
Output:
```
Something is happening before the function is called.
Hello!
Something is happening after the function is called.
```
**2. Generators**

Generators are a type of iterable, like lists or tuples, but they don't store all the values in memory at once. Instead, they generate values on the fly as they're needed.

Example:
```
def infinite_sequence():
    num = 0
    while True:
        yield num
        num += 1

seq = infinite_sequence()
for _ in range(10):
    print(next(seq))
```
Output:
```
0
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
```
**3. Lambda Functions**

Lambda functions are small, anonymous functions that can be defined inline within a larger expression.

Example:
```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squared_numbers = list(map(lambda x: x**2, numbers))
print(squared_numbers)
```
Output:
```
[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```
**4. Map, Filter, and Reduce**

Map, filter, and reduce are three important functions in Python that can be used to process data in a functional programming style.

Example:
```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Map
squared_numbers = list(map(lambda x: x**2, numbers))
print(squared_numbers)

# Filter
even_numbers = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers))
print(even_numbers)

# Reduce
from functools import reduce
sum_of_numbers = reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, numbers)
print(sum_of_numbers)
```
Output:
```
[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
[2, 4]
15
```
**5. Class Decorators**

Class decorators are similar to function decorators, but they're used to modify or extend the behavior of a class.

Example:
```
def singleton(cls):
    instances = {}
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in instances:
            instances[cls] = cls(*args, **kwargs)
        return instances[cls]
    return wrapper

@singleton
class Logger:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def log(self, message):
        print(f"{self.name}: {message}")

logger1 = Logger("logger1")
logger2 = Logger("logger2")

print(logger1 is logger2)
```
Output:
```
True
```
**6. Metaclasses**

Metaclasses are classes whose instances are classes. They can be used to modify or extend the behavior of a class.

Example:
```
class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, namespace):
        print(f"Creating class {name}")
        return type.__new__(cls, name, bases, namespace)

class MyClass(metaclass=Meta):
    pass
```
Output:
```
Creating class MyClass
```
**7. Abstract Base Classes**

Abstract base classes (ABCs) are classes that can't be instantiated on their own and are meant to be subclassed by other classes.

Example:
```
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class AbstractClass(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def do_something(self):
        pass

class ConcreteClass(AbstractClass):
    def do_something(self):
        print("Doing something")

try:
    AbstractClass()
except TypeError as e:
    print(e)

ConcreteClass().do_something()
```
Output:
```
Can't instantiate abstract class AbstractClass with abstract methods do_something
Doing something
```
**8. Descriptors**

Descriptors are objects that implement the descriptor protocol, which allows them to be used as attributes of a class.

Example:
```
class MyDescriptor:
    def __get__(self, instance, owner):
        return instance._value

    def __set__(self, instance, value):
        instance._value = value

class MyClass:
    attr = MyDescriptor()

    def __init__(self):
        self._value = None

obj = MyClass()
obj.attr = "hello"
print(obj.attr)
```
Output:
```
hello
```
**9. Context Managers**

Context managers are objects that implement the context management protocol, which allows them to be used with the `with` statement.

Example:
```
class MyContextManager:
    def __enter__(self):
        print("Entering context")
        return self

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        print("Exiting context")

with MyContextManager() as manager:
    print("Inside context")
```
Output:
```
Entering context
Inside context
Exiting context
```
**10. Type Hints**

Type hints are annotations that can be added to function and variable definitions to indicate the expected types of the values.

Example:
```
def greet(name: str) -> None:
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet("John")
```
Output:
```
Hello, John!
```
These are just a few examples of advanced software development concepts and syntax in Python. There are many more features and techniques to explore in the language.
